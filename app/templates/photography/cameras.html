  <h2>cameras</h2>
  <p>
    many of my best photos are taken with my dedicated digital cameras but i
    often have the most fun when using more restrictive cameras, like the one
    on my nintendo DSi. i'd also like to get my hands on a 35mm film camera
    so that i can try a more thoughtful approach to photography!
  </p>
  <p>
    almost all of the photos in my <a href="/photography/gallery">gallery</a>
    were taken with one of these cameras:

        this is my camera of choice when photography is the primary focus for a
        day out. i have three lenses which cover a good range of capabilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II (kit lens)</li>
        <li>sigma 70-300mm f4-5.6 DG macro (equivalent to 105-450mm)</li>
        <li>walimex 500mm f/8.0 (equivalent to 750mm)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        a lot of my best photos have been taken on this tiny camera because i
        always keep it in my pocket. its focal range is decent, equivalent to
        28&#8209;224mm on a 35mm sensor like the one above, but it has fairly
        limited manual controls. being able to focus as near as 1&nbsp;cm on a
        20&nbsp;MP sensor gives rise to some highly detailed macro shots!

  <h3>nintendo DSi</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        the nintendo DSi has a very simplistic point-and-shoot camera system
        with a 0.3&nbsp;MP sensor behind it, producing photos with a unique
        digital aesthetic. it has a decent selection of effects but,
        unsurprisingly, very few of them are useful for taking actual photos.
        my main DSi has a modified enclosure which i made by swapping parts
        between two separate black and white consoles.
