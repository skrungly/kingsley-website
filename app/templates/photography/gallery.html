<p>
  here are a handful of the pictures i've taken over the years, in no
  particular order!
</p>
<p>
  you may click on any preview to see the original photo in full quality and
  find out how it was taken. however, be aware that you are at the mercy of my
  home internet upload speed, so please have patience! most of these photos
  are taken directly from the camera, but those which have been cropped or
  edited are indicated as such in their file name (except for some pictures
  taken on my nintendo DSi, as it can apply fun effects while shooting).
