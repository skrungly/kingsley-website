# personal website

just a small personal flask site, made for fun!

### setup

deployment with docker is planned but not yet implemented. in the meantime,
launching the development server is as easy as:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv  # initial run only
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip -r requirements.txt  # initial run only
$ python -m flask run --debug
```
